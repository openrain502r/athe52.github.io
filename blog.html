<h1><i>my blog & announcements</i></h1>This is mainly gonna contain updates to my projects, and other misc. shit I decide to post.


<h2>6/09/23</h2>
I'm gonna remake lunarOS. Looking back, there are so many things I want to change - mainly since the beta screens were somewhat boring, they don't look as good as I hoped (<i>especially</i> compared to other fictional OSs like yumeOS, Callaina, ::arca, etc.), I didn't save the PDNs so I can't go back and redo them (plus, since the part 1 vid's already up). Instead, an updated version of lunarOS will be included in an upcoming project, which is going to be... like... 20 times more ambitious than lunarOS Part 1. And as for lunarOS Part 2? That's gonna be delayed. <i>More delayed than it already is...</i><br>-open
