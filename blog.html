<h1><i>my blog & announcements</i></h1>This is mainly gonna contain updates to my projects, and other misc. shit I decide to post.

<h2>9/09/23</h2>
Welp, I might as well say what that mysterious project is. It's called Project Fossil. Basically, imagine if someone went back in time, stepped on a leaf, and then caused history to change forever. Stuff such as: having the Industrial Revolution occur much sooner (around the time the aeolipile was invented), having inventions created from the 5th to the 15th centuries happen in a much shorter span of time, and when it comes to technology - having everything changed (from the UI to the fonts to the logos to the names. <i>Nothing is sacred</i>). But as of now, apart from that info I want to keep the project vague but interesting - kinda like what I did when I was working on lunarOS Part 1. It'll be coming soon, but I'll only start making mockups once I'm done with my "vanilla" ATL. So in other words, <i>a long fucking time from now</i>.<br>-open<br><i>P.S. If you looked in the HTML, you'd have seen a mention to Project Fossil.</i>. 
<!-- hello, anyone who's looking in the HTML! that project i've mentioned hundreds of times at this point is called project fossil - and it relates to what I've said before in TMS. i'll add more info soon, but if ya want info, DM me :) -->
<h2>8/09/23</h2>
lunarOS Part 2 is going to be on hold - indefinitely. Namely because of that upcoming project I mentioned. It'll be merged with my tech ATL, which will be coming... soon. If you want more info, DM me. Apart from that and some IRL stuff I won't mention - there's nothing much to it - except that project (imb4 minderianism) <br>-open<br>cc

<h2>6/09/23</h2>
I'm gonna remake lunarOS. Looking back, there are so many things I want to change - mainly since the beta screens were somewhat boring, they don't look as good as I hoped (<i>especially</i> compared to other fictional OSs like yumeOS, Callaina, ::arca, etc.), I didn't save the PDNs so I can't go back and redo them (plus, since the part 1 vid's already up). Instead, an updated version of lunarOS will be included in an upcoming project, which is going to be... like... 20 times more ambitious than lunarOS Part 1. And as for lunarOS Part 2? That's gonna be delayed. <i>More delayed than it already is...</i><br>-open
