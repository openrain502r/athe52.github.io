<h1><i>my blog & announcements</i></h1>This is mainly gonna contain updates to my projects, and other misc. shit I decide to post.

<h2>1/10/23</h2>
Welp, it's official. I'm killing off openrain502r and introducing a new identity. Welcome, athe52! So you might ask - why the name change? Well, it goes back to before I was called open. <br><br>
When I first started making some social media accounts, I originally had no idea what to name myself. So I just chose 2 random words and 3 numbers - this became Rainut987. The first social media account I have - a Twitch account I lost the password to - has this name. A few other website have it too. Though for some I didn't want to be named Rainut, e.g. my first DeviantArt, where I chose the name Cairo2011... dunno why I chose that, but oh well.<br>
Then, around 2018, I had done something a bit cringe in one of the servers. I was being a nuisance, and I decided to leave and come back to "reset my name" (<i>could you tell I was an idiot back then?</i>). But, I changed my name (on a whim, I might ask - no planning whatsoever) to help get around this cringe - albeit because I'm writing this it's gonna haunt me. Around this point, the timeline gets a bit blurry - but after my hiatus in late 2018 and 2019, I had the name openrain502r. And it stuck.<br><br>
Apart from a minor rebrand around late 2022, I had kept the same branding since 2018 - Ubuntu and Segoe were my main fonts. But now that I'm officially old enough to actually <i>use</i> a social media platform, I figured a rebrand was in check. So, welcome athe52, and goodbye openrain502r. It's been a wild ride.<br>-athe52<br><i>P.S. Branding will take affect soon. Hopefully it'll be done by tomorrow. I'm also gonna keep the old signatures on this blog.</i>

<h2>26/09/23</h2>
Well, ATL 1 is essentially cancelled - until ATL 2's spreadsheet is finished. I also had an odd dream a few days ago - something about my PC not working, installing what I though was Windows 12 (but it had the looks of Windows 10 and it was actually a mod of Windows 7...?), with my phone also having a similar interface. Back on the topic of ATL2, there's no longer that weird language I made up. I'd rather just keep it as English and change the timeline to fit. One last thing - it depends, and it might not even happen, but there might be a huge announcement coming soon. <!-- athe52, also hello to people viewing the html!--><br>-open<br><i>P.S. That "major announcement" wil almost certainly happen if I start learning Adobe apps... and Blender... and FL... and a bunch a' other shit.</i>

<h2>17/09/23</h2>
Nearly forgot about this thing, heh. Now that the IRL stuff is done, I'll be focusing on Fossil - fulltime. As of now it's barely done, only the Windows/Frames section is nearly done. But once that section is done I'll go back to doing the first ATL. I also have an idea for a completely <i>different</i> project - this one focusing on Analogue Horror. As of now though, it's just an idea, and I'm not even sure if it'll work. Especially since my past attempts of analogue horror <i>(*cough* *cough* the bad FNAF VHS I made 2-3 years ago)</i> haven't gone so well. On an unrelated note, I'm gonna try and become more active on the Rectify11 server, and also see if I can learn some software over my 2 weeks off. Stuff like Adobe apps, Vegas, Blender, Godot (cause screw Unity, especially <i>now</i>), and some others. <br>-open<br><i>P.S. Fossil is obviously gonna take a while, but it's around last on the priority list. Right now it's ATL 1 first, than some misc. mockups I want to make, then ATL 2. Go check out Octy's ATLs too.</i>

<h2>9/09/23</h2>
Welp, I might as well say what that mysterious project is. It's called Project Fossil. Basically, imagine if someone went back in time, stepped on a leaf, and then caused history to change forever. Stuff such as: having the Industrial Revolution occur much sooner (around the time the aeolipile was invented), having inventions created from the 5th to the 15th centuries happen in a much shorter span of time, and when it comes to technology - having everything changed (from the UI to the fonts to the logos to the names. <i>Nothing is sacred</i>). But as of now, apart from that info I want to keep the project vague but interesting - kinda like what I did when I was working on lunarOS Part 1. It'll be coming soon, but I'll only start making mockups once I'm done with my "vanilla" ATL. So in other words, <i>a long fucking time from now</i>.<br>-open<br><i>P.S. If you looked in the HTML, you'd have seen a mention to Project Fossil.</i> 
<!-- hello, anyone who's looking in the HTML! that project i've mentioned hundreds of times at this point is called project fossil - and it relates to what I've said before in TMS. i'll add more info soon, but if ya want info, DM me :) -->
<h2>8/09/23</h2>
lunarOS Part 2 is going to be on hold - indefinitely. Namely because of that upcoming project I mentioned. It'll be merged with my tech ATL, which will be coming... soon. If you want more info, DM me. Apart from that and some IRL stuff I won't mention - there's nothing much to it - except that project (imb4 minderianism) <br>-open<br>

<h2>6/09/23</h2>
I'm gonna remake lunarOS. Looking back, there are so many things I want to change - mainly since the beta screens were somewhat boring, they don't look as good as I hoped (<i>especially</i> compared to other fictional OSs like yumeOS, Callaina, ::arca, etc.), I didn't save the PDNs so I can't go back and redo them (plus, since the part 1 vid's already up). Instead, an updated version of lunarOS will be included in an upcoming project, which is going to be... like... 20 times more ambitious than lunarOS Part 1. And as for lunarOS Part 2? That's gonna be delayed. <i>More delayed than it already is...</i><br>-open
