<h1><i>my blog & announcements</i></h1>This is mainly gonna contain updates to my projects, and other misc. shit I decide to post. Times/days are in UTC+10. Anything that is censored can be revealed by highlighting it.

<h2>28/12/23</h2>
So, unless I do a post on New Years, this will probably be my final blog post of 2023. And what a year it's been. Compared to 2022, I have to admit that I felt like this year was better than last year. This year, I finished lunarOS History, which had been in development since like August 2022, and I'm currently working on Project Fossil right now (which is up to Frames Ruby as of now). Sure, this year has not been perfect <i>at all</i>, for mostly personal reasons I'm not digging into, alongside many political changes I definitely do not support.
<br> As for me? I did a major change and rebranded! I described why in a previous blog post. I'd also say that mentally, I'd consider myself better than last year, but at the same time I now have <i>zero</i> motivation - which is the main reason why I only do one "set" of mockups for Project Fossil a day - if even. I'm also considering entering other branches than just OSM and bad art I do - though judging from some responses about a test Flash animation I did, I'll still need some work obviously. Now if only I could get my hands on a Korg 01/W VST...<br>
I'm not sure what 2024 will bring. I do know that I'm entering my actual-senior years at school (because in Australia you can leave by Year 10), that I'll get more comfortable with my pre-existing friends both in real life and online, and that I'll almost certainly get my driver's license by then. As for the world... I'm mixed. There's the whole AI bubble that's rapidly inflating right now (who knows, it might be the next internet or the next .com bubble), the shit stain that is Project 2025 (look it up, it is <i>atrocious</i>, but it's an alt-right's wet dream) could win, which I would rather die than live in a USA post-Project, a bunch of climate change shit, etc. At best, Project 2025 dies in a whimper and the Ukraine war stops, or at worst, Project 2025 succeeds and I won't be able to live past 30. Sorry, am I rambling? I just want a better future for everyone, dammit.<br>
Alright, so to not end this on a depressing note, I might as well tell you a video series that I recently rediscovered - <i>Google Translated content!</i>, or in other words, a text obfuscator. It can either result in some "what the fuck?" or some major laughing fits, at least for me. Let's take Book of Mario (specifically Thousands of Doors, a mod of PM:TTYD by Fatguy703) for instance: the character Koops, <span class="spoiler">who's name is now Carbon, I might add</span>, goes from <span class="spoiler">being kinda timid and shy but adventerous to a psychopath who wants to kill his father, and I quote, "all" fathers. What the fuck</span>. There's another good moment in Chapter 7, where <span class="spoiler">Mario, (er, Bart perhaps...?) apparently <i>drops</i> one of the Glass Stars when collecting the "Crystals" star</span>. It's pretty good, and I recommend that you check it out. Be warned, there is a lot of swearing, both in Thousands of Doors and in the PM64 mod as well.
<br>-athe<br><i>P.S. "And in case I don't see ya... good afternoon, good evening and goodnight!" Just in case I don't write one on New Years.</i>

<h2>5/12/23</h2>
Man, I haven't updated this blog in <i>ages</i>. Oh well, welcome to December. And with it, I've been experimenting with Animate/Flash! It's using an old version (CS6), but I still find it fine to use, even if it's over... 10 years old? Fuck I feel old (:0. Nothing too complex, just me figuring out how to use motion tweens and keyframes, nothing too complex. I'm not gonna make the next BFDI in it - I haven't even figured out how to import audio yet. But if I ever decide to animate, then I'll probably use Flash and not a series of PNGs. <br>
Some other stuff I want to mention is me learning other programs - specifically Blender and FL Studio - apart from a brief stunt with Blender a while ago (back when I was still doing the concepts on my channel - the shitty ones made in PowerPoint), I don't know jack about either. Plus, the knowledge I "learned" in Blender is basically lost on me, so that's gonna be fun to re-learn. As for FL, I have it installed on my PC, but I have no clue how to use it. I'll probably have to look up some tutorials, with the same being said for 99% of Adobe's apps, any programming languages, Figma, and <i>anything</i> I.T. related outside of my knowledge now. It's gonna be a mission, but I hope I can learn something new and use that in my content.
<br>-athe<br><i>P.S. The only reason why I want to use FL is so I can make sounds for Project Fossil - especially since I have a variety of Korg VSTs at my disposal. I've finished Advanced Frames 3.0 (except revisions) as of now.</i>

<h2>6/11/23</h2>
I should've posted this yesterday, but by the time I went to bed it was like 11:40 PM. So I might as well write it now. Anyway, I've (basically) 100%'d Super Mario Bros Wonder, so let me give you my thoughts on it. <br>
Starting with the visuals - they look great. They FINALLY did stylisation in a Mario game and it looks fantastic - especially when one of the Wonder Flowers are in play and the visuals become more of a psychadellic acid trip than a video game. New Soup wishes it could be this pretty - and I like New Soup (well, the first two at least - NSMB2 and U are just kind of boring and I haven't gone around to playing NSLU because my Wii U's been broken for a few years now).<br>
On the subject of New Soup - this game overshadows it ten-fold. There's fun mechanics (e.g. the Wonder Flower and Badges), great stages (that are also surprisingly difficult, <span class="spoiler">looking at you, Badge Marathon especially</span>), a decent selection of characters (I usually played as Mario or Blue Toad, except for some difficult levels where I played as a Yoshi - because some of the later levels are hard AF), and some other elements come together to make a pretty good game. Even the talking flowers have charm to them - despite becoming annoying if you're stuck on a segment in a level (I kept hearing "Press R in mid-air!" soooooo many times on that last level). If you like platformers, I'd recommend it. You'll need a Switch (or Yuzu), though.
<br>-athe<br><i>P.S. By "basically 100%'d", I mean that apart from <span class="spoiler">the standees</span>, I've completed everything.</i>

<h2>31/10/23</h2>
Finally got around to watching the FNaF movie... and it was pretty good! I'm not gonna delve into spoilers too much, but even though it was formulaic and kinda predictable (for me, at least) - I still loved it. There's also the fact that it's been in development hell for the past 8 years, going from Warner to Universal, keeping Blumhouse somehow, and in general making a pretty good film. I also love the little references in this film - MatPat's in the film and says <span class="spoiler">breakfast is a theory, Springtrap</span> says <span class="spoiler">I always come back</span>, and even <span class="spoiler">the Living Tombstone's FNaF 1 song playing in the credits</span> - that one especially made be have a shit eating grin on my face :))). Also, yes I know Bonnie is blue, but in my heart (and according to old renders and those inaccurate models from like 2014/5), he will always be slightly purple.
<br>-athe<br><i>P.S. I have to thank a friend for giving me a copy of the film - I haven't been able to go to a cinema lately and I'm a cheap teen, as well :P. Also, in the fact that both this and the Mario Movie both got terrible critic responses but great audience responses shows that critics only care about the formula of a film, and not the "fun" factor.</i>

<h2>19/10/23</h2>
Welp, I've just discovered that someone on TikTok is <i>using my name!</i> I guess I should've done a name search before I rebranded... whoops.<br>
On an unrelated note - for Project Fossil I'm currently doing revisions for MC-DOS. Kinda boring, I know.
<br>-athe<br><i>P.S. Originally, this was going to be about "hurr durr they took mah handel!!!!1!1111", but then I realised the oldest posts are from 2021. Glad I didn't have that permanently online :P. Oh, and there's someone in some OSM servers called anth... I really should've done a name check.</i>

<h2>6/10/23</h2>
Couple things have happened in the past couple days. <br><br>First off, me and some of my IRL friends were talking about object shows, and I mentioned that I hadn't watched them in <i>years</i> (apart from the final of BFB and I think a bit of TPOT and II2?). So obviously they wanted me to rewatch some of them. And so I did. Starting with BFDI, the first season is pretty apt, despite it being made over 10 years ago and by literal kids (no joke!). The animation gets really good at points (like that one episode where they go into space with Bubble's facial animation), and in general I like how it actually finished!<br>
BFDIA was also pretty good (also apparently there's FINALLY A BFDIA 6 AND 7?!? Sign me the fuck up!), but after IA I kinda just stopped watching them. II2 was decent, with some notable standout episodes, and IDFB has a solid base. Then came BFB. I think I also watched this despite me not watching object shows at the time. I liked it, albeit after the TPoT split, the humor slowly became "haha loud and obnoxious = funny!!11!". Still pretty good though. And TPoT so far is decent, too. Some other object shows they reccommended me were ONE (which is fucking <i>fantastic</i>, I kinda want to include elements in some future project of mine), II (decent as said before), and some other one I forgot about.<br><br>
Second - no need for main.html or openrain502r.github.io anymore! They both redirect to the main home page - but now it's index! I'd still prefer if it was just athe52.github.io, GitHub can't change my name I guess.<br><br>
Third - progress on ATL2/Project Fossil is going somewhat smoothly - I'm only up to MC-DOS 7 so far. Hopefully I can speed up development time - it takes 1-1.5 hours just to make one screen (two plus if there's minor variations, such as the Dev Mode on MC-DOS), and that time isn't helped by the fact that I have little motivation. It will be done at some point - every OS and software, down to the revision and build number. Just don't expect hardware, I can't model in Blender at all.<br><br>
Fourth - at my school we are currently learning Premiere Pro. And on my PC it crashed so hard <i>it bluescreened the fucking computer.</i> It said something about memory management, but I just couldn't help but laugh. I wish I had a photo.<br><br>
And with that, that's about all. In case you just wanna get a TL:DR, just read this section:
<li>Watched some object shows (BF(I/IA/IDFB/B/TPOT), II, ONE, etc.) - some are decent and some are great</li>
<li>Many old links have been fixed.</li>
<li>ATL2 is going well.</li>
<li>Adobe crashed a school computer.</li>
<br>-athe<br><i>P.S. This article was originally going to be about the old links getting fixed and the Adobe crash, but I figured I might as well add some more stuff :P.</i>

<h2>4/10/23</h2>
So this post is more or less an addendum to the previous post. Some things of note is that the minor rebrand (from my old Windows Plus! BG from OSM 1 to a modified PS3 theme BG) had the logo finished in <i>April</i> 2022, not late 2022 (sorry for the confusion!), and that Tenorite was added to the family of fonts I used pre-Athe52 around that time period (or whenever Tenorite released).<br><br>
And on an unrelated note - <em>DON'T COPY AND PASTE THE LUNAROS PASTEBIN!</em> I'm looking at <i><a href="https://osm.fandom.com/wiki/Zia_Technologies?oldid=20279">you</a></i>, OS Mockups Wiki! That's just lazy. The same thing could be said to my own page - most of that was written back me on The Mockups Wiki before it got shut down the first time! And since then, it just has some minor additions - it hasn't even got my current name! On the other hand, the Mockupedia (while still using a segment written by me) has proper additions about current me, has my current name, but also has (red) links to dedicated OSM pages and even some images! It's a much better wiki page. Quantity over quality, y'know?<br><br>
Apart from that, I'm still working well on Project Fossil (which if it isn't already clear, is my second ATL - the one with Minicomp and medieval rockets), albeit because of IRL stuff it's gonna be a bit slow. Sorry about that.
<br>-athe<br><i>P.S. Sorry for killing the link to openrain502r.github.io. I'll set up a redirect at some point.</i>

<h2>1/10/23</h2>
Welp, it's official. I'm killing off openrain502r and introducing a new identity. Welcome, athe52! So you might ask - why the name change? Well, it goes back to before I was called open. <br><br>
When I first started making some social media accounts, I originally had no idea what to name myself. So I just chose 2 random words and 3 numbers - this became Rainut987. The first social media account I have - a Twitch account I lost the password to - has this name. A few other website have it too. Though for some I didn't want to be named Rainut, e.g. my first DeviantArt, where I chose the name Cairo2011... dunno why I chose that, but oh well.<br>
Then, around 2018, I had done something a bit cringe in one of the servers. I was being a nuisance, and I decided to leave and come back to "reset my name" (<i>could you tell I was an idiot back then?</i>). But, I changed my name (on a whim, I might ask - no planning whatsoever) to help get around this cringe - albeit because I'm writing this it's gonna haunt me. Around this point, the timeline gets a bit blurry - but after my hiatus in late 2018 and 2019, I had the name openrain502r. And it stuck.<br><br>
Apart from a minor rebrand around late 2022, I had kept the same branding since 2018 - Ubuntu and Segoe were my main fonts. But now that I'm officially old enough to actually <i>use</i> a social media platform, I figured a rebrand was in check. So, welcome athe52, and goodbye openrain502r. It's been a wild ride.<br>-athe52<br><i>P.S. Branding will take affect soon. Hopefully it'll be done by tomorrow. I'm also gonna keep the old signatures on this blog.</i>

<h2>26/09/23</h2>
Well, ATL 1 is essentially cancelled - until ATL 2's spreadsheet is finished. I also had an odd dream a few days ago - something about my PC not working, installing what I though was Windows 12 (but it had the looks of Windows 10 and it was actually a mod of Windows 7...?), with my phone also having a similar interface. Back on the topic of ATL2, there's no longer that weird language I made up. I'd rather just keep it as English and change the timeline to fit. One last thing - it depends, and it might not even happen, but there might be a huge announcement coming soon. <!-- athe52, also hello to people viewing the html!--><br>-open<br><i>P.S. That "major announcement" wil almost certainly happen if I start learning Adobe apps... and Blender... and FL... and a bunch a' other shit.</i>

<h2>17/09/23</h2>
Nearly forgot about this thing, heh. Now that the IRL stuff is done, I'll be focusing on Fossil - fulltime. As of now it's barely done, only the Windows/Frames section is nearly done. But once that section is done I'll go back to doing the first ATL. I also have an idea for a completely <i>different</i> project - this one focusing on Analogue Horror. As of now though, it's just an idea, and I'm not even sure if it'll work. Especially since my past attempts of analogue horror <i>(*cough* *cough* the bad FNAF VHS I made 2-3 years ago)</i> haven't gone so well. On an unrelated note, I'm gonna try and become more active on the Rectify11 server, and also see if I can learn some software over my 2 weeks off. Stuff like Adobe apps, Vegas, Blender, Godot (cause screw Unity, especially <i>now</i>), and some others. <br>-open<br><i>P.S. Fossil is obviously gonna take a while, but it's around last on the priority list. Right now it's ATL 1 first, than some misc. mockups I want to make, then ATL 2. Go check out Octy's ATLs too.</i>

<h2>9/09/23</h2>
Welp, I might as well say what that mysterious project is. It's called Project Fossil. Basically, imagine if someone went back in time, stepped on a leaf, and then caused history to change forever. Stuff such as: having the Industrial Revolution occur much sooner (around the time the aeolipile was invented), having inventions created from the 5th to the 15th centuries happen in a much shorter span of time, and when it comes to technology - having everything changed (from the UI to the fonts to the logos to the names. <i>Nothing is sacred</i>). But as of now, apart from that info I want to keep the project vague but interesting - kinda like what I did when I was working on lunarOS Part 1. It'll be coming soon, but I'll only start making mockups once I'm done with my "vanilla" ATL. So in other words, <i>a long fucking time from now</i>.<br>-open<br><i>P.S. If you looked in the HTML, you'd have seen a mention to Project Fossil.</i> 
<!-- hello, anyone who's looking in the HTML! that project i've mentioned hundreds of times at this point is called project fossil - and it relates to what I've said before in TMS. i'll add more info soon, but if ya want info, DM me :) -->
<h2>8/09/23</h2>
lunarOS Part 2 is going to be on hold - indefinitely. Namely because of that upcoming project I mentioned. It'll be merged with my tech ATL, which will be coming... soon. If you want more info, DM me. Apart from that and some IRL stuff I won't mention - there's nothing much to it - except that project (imb4 minderianism) <br>-open<br>

<h2>6/09/23</h2>
I'm gonna remake lunarOS. Looking back, there are so many things I want to change - mainly since the beta screens were somewhat boring, they don't look as good as I hoped (<i>especially</i> compared to other fictional OSs like yumeOS, Callaina, ::arca, etc.), I didn't save the PDNs so I can't go back and redo them (plus, since the part 1 vid's already up). Instead, an updated version of lunarOS will be included in an upcoming project, which is going to be... like... 20 times more ambitious than lunarOS Part 1. And as for lunarOS Part 2? That's gonna be delayed. <i>More delayed than it already is...</i><br>-open
